Unicorn Hunt
=============


This is a game I created as part of a weekend gamejam. The topic was 
unicorns....

This is my first attempt at using pygame, so most of it is from 
scratch. There are a lot of possible enhancements, but gamejam lasts 40 
hours so time was limited.

There are an annoying graphics thing at the beginning, so press space 
and start moving, and the game is playable.

The game is a two-player game

* bad guy: Uses awsd to move around and to catch the unicorn.

* unicorn: Use arrow keys to get to the maiden.

The maiden will move away from the bad guy and towards the unicorn.

Stale code includes remote access to play the game over the network and 
more *AI*-ish stuff to automatically move the sprites in a 
non-implemented demo mode.
